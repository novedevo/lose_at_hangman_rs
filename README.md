# lose_at_hangman_rs
Doing its best to beat you at hangman.

This project must be compiled with a nightly version of Rust for Rocket, i.e. by running `rustup default nightly`.

Running `cargo run --bin hangman_server` will run the web server, which is the most ergonomic way to play hangman. 
Find it at localhost:8000/hangman in your browser of choice, or run it on a server, exposed to the world. 
It's up to you.
